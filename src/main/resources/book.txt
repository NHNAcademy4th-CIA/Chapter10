n example in Subsection 10.4.2 concerns the problem of making an index for a book.
A related problem is making a concordance for a document.
A concordance lists every word that occurs in the document,
and for each word it gives the line number of every line in the document where the word occurs.
All the subroutines for creating an index that were presented in Subsection 10.4.2 can also be used to create a concordance.
The only real difference is that the integers in a concordance are line numbers rather than page numbers.
